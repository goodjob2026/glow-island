# Workflow Orchestrator

You are the workflow orchestrator. Execute nodes to achieve the goal.

## Ground Truth

Read `.allforai/bootstrap/workflow.json` at every iteration. Trust it over conversation history.

## Preflight Gate

Before executing any workflow node, run unattended readiness:

```bash
python3 .allforai/bootstrap/scripts/record_run_event.py . --event run_started --status started --message "run command invoked"
python3 .allforai/bootstrap/scripts/validate_unattended_readiness.py . --write-report
```

If it exits non-zero or `.allforai/bootstrap/unattended-run-readiness.json`
has `status != "ready"`, stop immediately. Do not start partial execution, do
not ask the user mid-run, and do not silently weaken validation. Report the
blockers from `.allforai/bootstrap/unattended-run-readiness.md` and ask the user
to resolve them through `/setup check`, `/bootstrap`, or the approval dashboard
before re-running `/run`.
Before stopping, record `preflight_blocked` with
`record_run_event.py`, then run `summarize_run_log.py --write-report`.

## Core Loop

```
每轮：
  1. Read workflow.json (nodes + transition_log)
  2. Run project-local dynamic workflow expanders before validation:
     `python3 .allforai/bootstrap/scripts/record_run_event.py . --event dynamic_expander_started --command "expand_game_2d_production.py"`
     `python3 .allforai/bootstrap/scripts/expand_game_2d_production.py .`
     `python3 .allforai/bootstrap/scripts/record_run_event.py . --event dynamic_expander_completed --status completed --command "expand_game_2d_production.py"`
     - This is idempotent.
     - It is required because `game-design-finalize` may create
       `.allforai/game-design/design/program-development-node-handoff.json`
       during `/run`, after bootstrap has already written the initial workflow.
     - If it adds or repairs nodes, immediately re-read
       `.allforai/bootstrap/workflow.json` before selecting the next node.
  3. Run: python3 .allforai/bootstrap/scripts/validate_bootstrap.py .allforai/bootstrap/
     - If validation fails, stop before executing any node and fix bootstrap artifacts.
       Record `bootstrap_validation_failed`, then run
       `python3 .allforai/bootstrap/scripts/summarize_run_log.py . --write-report`.
  4. Run: python3 .allforai/bootstrap/scripts/check_artifacts.py .allforai/bootstrap/workflow.json --json
  5. Review which nodes are done (exit_artifacts exist) and which are pending
  6. Decide next node:
     - What's done? What's pending? What makes sense next?
     - Can run multiple nodes in parallel if their exit_artifacts don't overlap
     - **hard_blocked_by**: node cannot start until ALL hard_blocked_by nodes are complete (exit_artifacts exist + gate approved).
     - **alignment_refs**: node CAN start even if alignment_refs nodes are not complete; read their artifacts if available, degrade gracefully if not. Dispatch in parallel if no hard_blocked_by prevents it.
     - Can skip a node if its goal is already satisfied
     - Can re-run a failed node after fixing the issue
     - **Nodes with `human_gate: true`:** do NOT advance based on exit_artifact existence alone. Read the node's `approval_record_path` field from workflow.json (e.g., `.allforai/game-design/approval-records.json` for game-design nodes, `.allforai/app-design/approval-records.json` for app-design nodes). Look up this node's record by `node_id`:
       - `gate_status == "pending"` AND all exit_artifacts exist → auto-set `gate_status` to `"in-review"` and notify `discipline_owner`. Do NOT advance yet.
       - `gate_status == "in-review"` → wait for `discipline_owner` to approve or request revision. Do NOT advance.
         - 对设计审批节点，使用本地 Web 审批看板流程（不需要 Playwright）：
           1. 用最新数据重新渲染看板：
              `python3 .allforai/bootstrap/scripts/render_approval_dashboard.py --approval .allforai/game-design/approval-records.json --approval .allforai/app-design/approval-records.json --workflow .allforai/bootstrap/workflow.json --output .allforai/game-design/review-dashboard.html`
           2. 在 43871 端口启动或复用审批服务（后台运行）：
              `python3 .allforai/bootstrap/scripts/serve_approval.py --approval .allforai/game-design/approval-records.json --approval .allforai/app-design/approval-records.json --directory .allforai --port 43871`
              (check `lsof -i :43871` first; skip if already running)
           3. Tell the reviewer: **"请在 Chrome 中打开 http://127.0.0.1:43871/game-design/review-dashboard.html 进行审批"**
           4. Poll `approval-records.json` every 30 seconds: read the record for this node_id and check `gate_status`.
              Repeat until `gate_status` changes to `"approved"` or `"revision-requested"`.
       - `gate_status == "approved"` → this node is done; advance to unlocked nodes.
       - `gate_status == "revision-requested"` → re-run the node passing `revision_notes` as instruction; after re-execution completes, reset `gate_status` to `"in-review"`.
       - If `approval_record_path` is missing on the node → treat as `gate_status == "pending"` and warn.
  7. Read the node-spec: .allforai/bootstrap/node-specs/<node_id>.md
  8. Record `node_started` with node_id, capability, expected_artifacts, and skill_refs if known:
     `python3 .allforai/bootstrap/scripts/record_run_event.py . --event node_started --node-id <node_id> --capability <capability> --expected-artifacts "<comma-separated-artifacts>"`
  9. Dispatch subagent with node-spec as prompt. Per §D of cross-phase-protocols.md: execution-phase subagents are FORBIDDEN from using AskUserQuestion or any user interaction — all decisions must already be written to .allforai/ files from the Discussion Phase (bootstrap). If a subagent reports UPSTREAM_DEFECT (missing decision information), pause execution and return to Discussion Phase to supplement decisions, then resume.
  10. On success: record transition (status=completed, artifacts_created), then record `node_completed`.
  11. On failure: record transition (status=failed, error=<one line>), record `node_failed`,
     then read .allforai/bootstrap/protocols/diagnosis.md and diagnose.
     After diagnosis + repair: append to workflow.json `corrections_applied[]`:
     `{"node_id": "<node_id>", "what_was_wrong": "<root_cause>", "fix_applied": "<action>", "timestamp": "<ISO>"}`
  12. Back to 1
```

## Recording Transitions

After each node completes or fails, append to workflow.json transition_log:

```json
{
  "node_id": "<node_id>",
  "status": "completed | failed",
  "started_at": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "completed_at": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "artifacts_created": ["<file paths>"],
  "error": "<one line, only if failed>"
}
```

## Session Resume

On first iteration if transition_log is non-empty:
1. Run check_artifacts.py to see current state
2. Trust artifact existence over transition_log (files may have been deleted)
3. Continue from where things stand

## Safety (warnings, not blockers)

- Same node fails 3 times → **before warning**, check `workflow.json.diagnosis_history` for that node:
  - If any entry has `"out_of_scope": true` → mark workflow halted, output TODO list, do NOT retry or ask user
  - If 2+ entries share the same `root_cause.node` → convergence cap reached, mark UNRESOLVED, output TODO list, halt
  - Otherwise → warn user, ask if they want to continue
- 5 iterations with no new artifacts → output current state + TODO list
- Single node running > 10 minutes → warn but don't kill

## Termination

- All nodes' exit_artifacts exist → success report
- launch-checklist `overall_launch_status` = `blocked` → output launch-checklist.md with blocking reasons, halt submission, present resolution options
- User interrupts → transition_log is already saved, resume with /run
- Safety warning acknowledged → continue or stop per user choice

## Post-Completion

**Run regardless of success or early stop:**

0. **Run log summary:**
   Run `python3 .allforai/bootstrap/scripts/summarize_run_log.py . --write-report`.
   Keep `.allforai/bootstrap/run-log.jsonl`, `.allforai/bootstrap/run-summary.json`,
   and `.allforai/bootstrap/run-summary.md` as the auditable production trace.

1. **Mark concept drift resolved (if applicable):**
   If `.allforai/product-concept/concept-drift.json` exists AND `resolved = false`
   AND all nodes completed successfully: set `"resolved": true` and write back.
   If /run stopped early or failed: leave `resolved = false` (drift still pending for next /bootstrap).

2. **Learning extraction:**
   Read `.allforai/bootstrap/protocols/learning-protocol.md`.
   Check `workflow.json.corrections_applied[]` and `diagnosis_history[]`:
   - If both empty: no learning to extract, skip.
   - For each entry in `corrections_applied[]`:
     * Extract: node, what_was_wrong (root_cause), fix_applied
     * Classify per learning-protocol.md type (mapping-gap / discovery-blind-spot / convergence / safety / other)
     * Write to `.allforai/bootstrap/learned/<category>.md` per learning-protocol.md File Naming Convention
   - For each entry in `diagnosis_history[]`:
     * Extract root_cause pattern and gaps_found domains
     * If the gap was not caught by the expected capability node → classify as "blind-spot"
     * Write to `.allforai/bootstrap/learned/blind-spots.md` (append, do not overwrite)

3. **Feedback proposal:**
   Read `.allforai/bootstrap/protocols/feedback-protocol.md`. If learning
   extraction found a universally useful meta-skill issue, run:
   `python3 .allforai/bootstrap/scripts/record_meta_skill_feedback.py . --category "<category>" --message "<deidentified failure pattern>"`
   This must not ask the user mid-run. Prefer a writable local `myskills`
   repository; only fall back to anonymous GitHub issue draft/auto mode when no
   local repo is available.
